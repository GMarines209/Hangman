# Hangman
A small C project recreating the icoic hangman game! 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Made entirely in C!

## Lessons Learned:

With this being one of my first fully completed small projects i've worked on, this project allowed me to explore different factets of C that needed some reienforcement. the use of 2D arrays, strings, and pointers are so important for the foundations of C yet still fairly new to me and I would take any practice with them that helps build up my understanding. File I/O is also decently new to me so it was fun exploring the differnt tings i could do with it. While small this is one of the first projects ive seen to the end and completed, the sense of acomplishment after seeing everything work correctly for the first time is one i wish to see more often with more projects from me in the future.
